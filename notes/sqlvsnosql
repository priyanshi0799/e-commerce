DB makes storing and accessing data easy.

SQL -> MYSQL DB
NoSQL -> MongoDB

SQL (Structured Query Language)
    Queries are the commands used to interact with the DB.
    Stores data in the form of tables.
    Allows to relate different tables.
    Strong "Data Schema" -> All data in the table has to fit!
    Data Relation -> One to One, One to Many and Many to Many.

    Eg: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28

NoSQL
    Here "Collections" are equivalent to "Tables".
    Inside Collections we have "Documents" -> equivalent to Records in Table
    They are "Schemaless"
    Instead of "Relation", we duplicate the data to connect two Collections.
    No Joining or complicated Nesting queries, hence faster
