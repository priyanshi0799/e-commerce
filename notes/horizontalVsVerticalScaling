With vertical scaling (a.k.a. “scaling up”), you’re adding more power to your 
existing machine. 
In horizontal scaling (a.k.a. “scaling out”), you get the additional resources into 
your system by adding more machines to your network, sharing the processing and 
memory workload across multiple devices.


One way to look at it is to think of vertical scaling like retiring your Toyota and 
buying a Ferrari when you need more horsepower. With your super-fast car, you can 
fly at top speed with the windows down and look amazing. But, while Ferraris are 
awesome, they’re not very practical, they’re expensive, and at the end of the day, 
they can only take you so far before they’re out of gas. (Not to mention, there’s 
only two seats!)

Horizontal scaling gets you that added horsepower – not by ditching the Toyota for 
the Ferrari, but by adding another vehicle to the mix. In fact, you can think of 
horizontal scaling like several vehicles you can drive all at once. Maybe none of 
these machines is a Ferrari, but no one of them needs to be: across the fleet, you 
have all the horsepower you need.
